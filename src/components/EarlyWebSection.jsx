                    Early web design in the 1990s was simple and text-based, with static HTML 
                    pages and minimal graphics due to slow internet speeds. <br />
                    Layouts relied on tables, fonts were limited to system defaults, and bright 
                    colors or animated GIFs were common. <br /> Cross-browser compatibility 
                    was a challenge during the "browser wars," and the introduction of 
                    CSS in the mid-1990s began improving design flexibility. <br />This era set the stage for modern web development.

                    The worldâ€™s first website was created By Tim Berners-Lee on August 6, 1991 and is still online.
                    Although its not much by todays standards, its the grandparent of all websites ever.
