      title: 'SKEUOMORPHISM',
      description: 'Skeuowmorphism began to take shape in the 1980s. One of its earliest proponents was Steve Jobs of Apple. The idea was simple ; computer interfaces would be much more intuitive to users if skeuomorphic design were applied. .',
      description2: 'Skeuomorphism helped a generation through the learning curve of coming to grips with a digital era. But, it also began to hold us back. We became familiar with the concepts and they entered the language and our day-to-day lives but skeuomorphic design led to huge amounts of clutter on the desktop. ',

      title: 'FLAT DESIGN',
      description: 'In 2007, Forbes magazine announced the death of skeuomorphism. Apple settled on a new design - flat design.  Flat design mandated that graphic user interfaces should be freed from clutter. ',
      description2: 'Flat design is a style of interface design that rejects the 3D elemenes of skewmorphism. It does not abandon in but rather focuses on rendering objects in flat minimalist form. It avoids the excessive use of gradients, textures, and drop shadows designed to deliver 3D effects for simpler elements focusing on simple flat elements, typography and glat color schemes. ',
      description3: 'Flat design is not entirely new and has been inspired from 3 existing forms of art: The Swiss Style, Bauhaus and Modernism.  Flat design in the real world became popularized in the 1950 and 1960s but the digital world would be rather slower to catch up. ',

        title: 'NEUOMORPHISM',
        description: 'Neumorphism is basically “New Skeumorphism”, so skeumorphism with a modern twist. It’s got a bit of a “soft” look and feel that reminds a bit of flat design. Even though it relates to skeuomorphism, there is a new focus in the entire UI design style with neumorphism. This focus is not necessarily on the contrast or similarity between the real and digital worlds, but rather the color palette.',
        description2: 'One of the most interesting things about neumorphism is that it draws from both skeuomorphism and other massively popular styles, such as flat design.',
        description3: 'Neumorphism UI takes the core tenets of flat design—clean lines, minimalist aesthetic, and an emphasis on function—and infuses them with a hint of playful depth.Neumorphism isn’t about mimicking the real world like skeuomorphism’s clunky buttons and leather textures. It’s a new language entirely, one that speaks of clean lines and a hint of refinement.',
